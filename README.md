# openlib
Simple library of everyday use for C++</br>
The code is **not** claimed as authored, as it is a collectiion of ancillary libraries used over the years, and collected from sources on the Internet and cutomized as well.

## Singleton
Colected from the web, there a many implementations of this out there, this one is simple and it works (not re-inventing the wheel)

## Buffer
I have created counteless of this, so I decided to put one out there for people to use. For every ICD that needs implemnetation, you parse data from a buffer and to the buffer. For the embeeded folks, this is a common tool.
