# [openlib](https://github.com/javier-acosta-m/openlib)
It is a collection of C++ tools (classes utilities) that I have developed (and/or customized) over the years and used on Embeeded systems. The code is **not** claimed to be authored, as it has evolved from ancillary libraries, from sources on the Internet from many places.

## Singleton
Collected from the web, there a many implementations of this out there, this one is simple and it works (not re-inventing the wheel)

## Buffer
I have created countless of this, so I decided to put one out there for people to use. For every ICD that needs implementation, you parse data from a buffer and to the buffer. For the Embeeded folks, this is a common tool.

## Enum
Common enumeration types used across the library.

## ICD
Base class to describes a message fields as well as the definition on the wire, used hand-in-hand with the buffer library.

## Utils 
Collection of ancillary functions definitions.
